# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
In this repository I used JavaScript's GeoJSON to create an interactive map to visualize earthquakes around the world. The focus was to visually show the difference in the magnitude of the earthquakes and showing the tectonic plates. To bring the visual together it was important to create tile layers to switch between satellite, street, and dark mode. The color we chose to show the earthquakes were based on the magnitude for each individual earthquake. To show the visually show the magnitude of each earthquake we built a legend in the lower right.

### In this preview you can see I was able to build a toggle to switch the overview of the map as well
